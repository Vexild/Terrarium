# Terrarium
Diploma project from Bachelors degree of Software Development in Oulun Ammattikorkeakoulu 2018

I graduated in 2018 and wanted to have video games and video game AI based thesis. 

## Components
Project Terrarium consists of two main components: Decision making and A* based pathfinding

### Decision making
Scene has an "ant" that has statistics, environment with modifiers and ability to move between points. There's also a modifier panel for environmental variables (salary, food price etc)
When ever ant's statistics meet preset conditions it makes a new decision. 

### Pathfinding
Scene has two maps. Starting the scene spawns a treasure somewhere in the map and an ant. Ant seeks the shortest and easiest path from its spawning point all the way to the treasure.
Terrain in the map has passing values. For short, roads are easier to move than difficult terrain

## Then?
I was very pleased to this project. It was done in 2018/06 but yet I have not continued any component.
